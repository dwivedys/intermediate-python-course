# Intermediate Python Course

Hey there, 

In this course you will create a dice-rolling program using python. The code you create will be stored in the dice-roller.py file. This repo also contains course materials under the issues tab. 

The multiplayer program can take a fixed number of players, ask them to roll a number of dices, add up the totals they got and then from amongst the participating players choose the one that rolled the highest dice sum and hence the winner of the play.
